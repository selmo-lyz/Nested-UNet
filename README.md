# Nested-UNet Replication

This repository contains an simple replication of the neural network model form [UNet++: A Nested U-Net Architecture for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10165) and applies this model to solve the [MICCAI 2017 LiTS](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B0vscETPGI1-Q1h1WFdEM2FHSUE?resourcekey=0-XIVV_7YUjB9TPTQ3NfM17A) and [LNDb Challenge](https://lndb.grand-challenge.org/Home/).

**Note:** Currently, the model is still under development and has not yet achieved satisfactory results. Further improvements and experiments are ongoing.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11.11
- Pytorch 2.6
- CUDA 12.6
